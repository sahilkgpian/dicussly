# Discussly - Create Your Rooms, Join Discussions, and Connect Worldwide 
Discussly, a Django-powered platform inspired by Discord, where users can log in, create and join rooms, and engage in meaningful conversations. The platform allows users to manage their profiles, edit or delete their rooms and comments, and maintain full control over their interactions. A dynamic activity sidebar showcases recent actions, such as the latest comments by users, along with the rooms they were posted in and the content of the comments. Discussly fosters collaboration and seamless communication with intuitive features and real-time activity tracking.
# Below is the home page of the website where a logged in user can see all the created rooms for discussion of certain topics and in right sidebar all the recent activities which basically displays the latest comments made by users, indicating the room and content of the comment for quick access.
